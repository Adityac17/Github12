## 📖 About
This repository contains my code solutions, notes, and mini-projects created while following **Tim Buchalka's Python Programming Masterclass** on Udemy.

The goal of this repository is to document my progression from Python basics to advanced concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and database management.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
I have organized the files by the sections/modules of the course:

* **`01_Basics`**: Variables, Strings, and Data Types.
* **`02_Control_Flow`**: If/Else, For Loops, While Loops.
* **`03_Lists_and_Tuples`**: Mutable vs Immutable data structures.
* **`04_Functions`**: Methods, Docstrings, and *args/**kwargs.
* **`05_Dictionaries_Sets`**: Key-value pairs and hashing.
* **`06_OOP`**: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
* **`07_Modules`**: Imports and standard libraries.

## 🚀 Projects & Exercises
Here are some of the key challenges I have solved:

| Project/Exercise | Description | Key Concepts Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Password Generator** | Generates random strong passwords | `random`, `loops` |
| **Caesar Cipher** | Encrypts text by shifting letters | `strings`, `logic` |
| **Shopping List** | A CLI tool to manage items | `lists`, `input/output` |
| **OOP Account System** | Simulates a bank account | `Classes`, `Methods` |
